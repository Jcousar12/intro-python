# Two parts that are needed to create a function are function defintion and function call.
# Function Defintion--> Defines the functions. Tells
# the program how your function works.
# Saves the instructions and runes when its called.
# Goodmorning()# runs and executes the instructions.




# A function parameter is the variable listed inside the parenthesis in the function defintion. 
#An argument is the value that is sent to the function when its called. "
